# ft_printf
**ft_printf - Custom Implementation of printf in C**


ft_printf is a user-implemented version of the standard C printf function. Designed from scratch, it replicates and extends the behavior of printf, offering formatted output capabilities for strings, integers, characters, and other data types. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of variadic functions, format specifiers, and efficient memory management in C.

**Features**

Supports a variety of format specifiers, including:

%c for characters

%s for strings

%d/%i for signed integers

%u for unsigned integers

%x/%X for hexadecimal numbers

%p for pointers

Handles edge cases and ensures robust formatting.
Mimics standard printf behavior, while being entirely handcrafted.
Learning Objectives

Understand variadic functions and how to handle a variable number of arguments in C.
Implement robust error handling and format validation.
Practice efficient use of low-level string and memory operations.
